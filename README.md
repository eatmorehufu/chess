# Chess

## About
This is a two-player chess game written in Ruby and played in the console. It
features the full range of chess movement, including castling, pawn promotion,
and last but not least (and very infrequently used) en passant. Creating this
game involved using a series of algorithms to check the validity of potential
moves. There is a multi-level class inheritance structure to DRYly enable
piece movement.

## Features
- Validates full range of chess movement, including en passant
- Chess coordinate notation for ease of input
- Check, checkmate, and stalemate checks and notifications

## To-Do
- Basic AI that uses breadth-first searches to choose moves
- Fully transition to chess notation from coordinate notation
- A printout of the full game's chess notation to allow real-world sharing
- Browser based GUI
